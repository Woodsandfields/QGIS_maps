This repository gathers different map (elements of) projects made with and around the Knight Foundation course for journalists about GIS and Mapping, using the QGIS software. 

Although it doesn't provide the essential reproducibility features of R programming and its packages dedicated to plots and maps (sf, ggplot2, etc.), QGIS is a highly powerful program which can turn into a wonderful investigation tool. That's why learning it with the Knight Foundation for journalists was a great choice.


SUMMARY
_______

Maps made with tutos by the Knight Foundation
=============================================

**First map**

- Importing files
- Discovering the interface and the diverse selection tools
- Accessing the attribute table and exploring properties

**World fertility**

Making a choropleth map showing the fertility rates across the globe.

Skills learned:
- merging two files for a map with additional features
- set the right parameters for a successful choropleth map
- choosing the breaks
- reflecting on the choice of colors. 

**San Marino**

This map intends to show a dot-density map for the small state of San Marino: each point represents here an habitant.

Skills learned:
- isolate a country from a world map, 
- exploit the corresponding csv file, modify if necessary from within QGIS
- shape the dot-density map appropriately.

**Airports**

The idea is to run a point-in-polygon analysis so as compute and visualize how many airports there are in each country.
