This repository gathers different map elements of projects made with and around the Knight Foundation course for journalists about GIS and Mapping, using the QGIS software. 

Although it doesn't provide the essential reproducibility features of R programming and its packages dedicated to plots and maps (sf, ggplot2, etc.), QGIS is a highly powerful program which can turn into a wonderful investigation tool. That's why learning it with the Knight Foundation for journalists was a great choice.
