"Cartograms and perhaps even hexograms distort our view of a geographic location. It becomes difficult to pinpoint where you live or where your aunt in Florida lives when perhaps your location is squeezed smaller and her home state is bloated outward. But I think these do well in giving us an idea of data and how it plays out. Perhaps you can better understand the influence of factors like population, national elections, or industry locations by seeing how odd it looks when your sYense of place is distorted." Helen Schneider, Albany County, NY, journalist

I so much agree with you in every nuance and I like your words. 

Hexograms and cartograms are no substitute to undistorted maps in the end, yet they can be put next to other maps for a different representation of some data. They can convey specific insights about, as you put it, "the influence of factors". In some situations, especially cartograms, and maybe the less elegant hexograms as well, can give a sense of what locations really weigh in regard to some issue. 

Truth be told, we do already have distorted views of countries, regions, continents, and places, and we are used to see where we belong as bigger than it is: We put symbolic weight on the places that matter to us. Also, in other situations, we might feel ashamed of the subjective inferiority our place carries like a stigma. We see the world through a weird lense that makes it always look other than it is. Thus, distorting locations voluntarily through cartographic means offers us a renewed view of the world, factor by factor, issue by issue. The world becomes mobile, changing, ephemeral as it truly is, weighing differently in its components in regard to what we want to immediately consider and analyze. This destroys so much of the "centricity" we tend to put everywhere, every time, every way. Just for that, I find it brilliant. Journalists have to use this with the best of their talent.
