Mapping with advanced tools of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has provided to journalists already for a while a wonderful opportunity to investigate differently and report in new ways. Although this opportunity might lead to unique insights and extraordinary presentations, the recent history of the tools as well as the technical difficulty to master the technology make their use still cumbersome - else too often leads to poor results. 

It is good to remember that journalism, like any classical profession, is the result of a long past of cumulative know-how, of collective reflection and passionate debates in the newspaper offices and the editorial boards, of experience gained through pain and hard work over decades by the best journalists - and transmitted in generous ways by the most loved editors-in-chiefs in the secrecy of many exchanges side by side. 

Thus, it comes as no surprise that some of the greatest investigations are made by a pool of collaborative journalists, not by some bold maverick, - although the two aspects coexist in every good journalist: cooperative and open, but also stubborn and hard-necked. This collaborative feature behind great maps proves particularly true in the largest "geographic" investigations, where we mostly see several journalists working together to get to results, - sometimes after months of trial and reflection. One recent example is the mapped investigation the NYT published in July 2018 called [Do you live in a political bubble?"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/25/upshot/precinct-map-highlights.html), which was signed "by the upshot staff".

The three maps
==============

Here we examine and compare three maps belonging to the "geographic investigation" category and using maps as a fully-featured reporting dimension. 

- The first map is [**"the Royinga crisis: life in the camps", by Reuter news agency**](http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-ROHINGYA/010051VB46G/index.html). It was published in December 2017 and intends to give *"a closer look at life in camps"* and explain through mapping why there is here *"a recipe for disaster"*. 

- The second map is [**"US is more diverse than ever - but still segregated", from The Washington Post**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/segregation-us-cities/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2a68fbaa4034). It is signed by Aaron Williams and Armand Emamdjomeh and the latest published update on the web goes back to May 2018. It starts with the idea that *"the United States is on track to be a majority-minority nation by 2044"* but gives new highlights on this problematic by demonstrating that *"census data show most of our neighbors are the same race."*

- The third map is [**How one Houston suburb ended up in a reservoir, from the New York Times**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/22/us/houston-harvey-flooding-reservoir.html), by Tim Wallace, Derek Watkins, Haeyoun Park, Anjali Singhvi and Josh Williams. It was published in March 2018 and tells the story of how Hurricane Harvey rose water inside two large reservoirs *to historic levels, flooding thousands of homes."*


Reuters' Royinga refugee camps: useful evidence or inappropriate demonstration?
=============================================================

Reuters is no newspaper but a news agency. As such, it aims to provide press material of journalistic quality abiding by the highest standards, while focusing on detailed, precise content before story. With this presentation of the Royinga refugee camp crisis however, Reuters adopts an elegant style of presentation which in addition mixes the genres and makes me feel uncomfortable. 

Admittedly, I quite like the introducing panoramic video from above which the report opens with: It reminds of many movies starting with the same kind of images, thus clearly indicating the director wants to represent the true life of all the people of the place, else of specific people but coming from that environment as the larger, inescapable frame of the story. Yet, this introduction proves wrong in our case: we won't be invited to discover more people in the rest of the report than we see in this footage, nor will we read the personal stories or hear the voices of refugees themselves. 

On the contrary, the rest of the investigation provides maps and comments as if coming from an NGO report in order to demonstrate the major issues coming with the camps. Sometimes, the maps get hard to read: too much information on them, too many dots, although we are not local camp administrators. The whole report is visually elegant though.

Yet, couldn't the whole thing be more austere as an echo to the living conditions in the camp? While elegant indeed, it doesn't feature any individual character. People are missing. Therefore, the introducing panorama we liked as a promise of human empathy reminds us now rather of a surveillance video. To me, this is bad taste. And wrong journalism. Choose what you want to show, but be respectful of the people whatever your choice. Disrespect and crisis and trauma and indifference are everywhere. A journalist's job starts here. They have to know how to present things. 

However, the maps, even if disappointingly uneasy to grasp despite the general elegant presentation and shockingly humanless, get it right at some point: The demonstration is clear, and, after this report, viewers can't overlook the issue anymore: the refugee crisis is more dramatic than the rest of the world wants to know, and action is urgently needed.

I pointed at what I see as limitations of the map. I want to know to reflect on the fact that the originality of the presentation might help get past the traditional audience barriers, reaching to a larger public while being more striking for decision-makers themselves, which of course is a good point. Lastly, this cartographic report might remind us of the famous John Snow's mapping of London's sanitation network, which helped stop cholera and open a new era of better public health. Like an endless beginning, which is yet to be done. Again and again.  


Washington Post's racial segregation: beauty from within
========================================================

Our Knight Foundation instructor asked if this map would be interesting to people living outside the US. Definitely, it is. This is human geography. This is contemporary history. And this is an intellectual endeavor both of interest and of beauty. As such, it makes one stop, whatever the country they are from. To reflect on, and contemplate, ourselves as we live. 

This investigation is around a detailed map of the US elaborated thanks to data collected specially for it: "*The Post analyzed census data from 1990, 2000, 2010 and the latest estimates from the 2016 five-year American Community Survey.*" As explained in a video interview made by the Knight Foundation for its students with one of the authors of the map, it took several people (beyond the two authors) as well as months of work to achieve this result. As detailed in the footnotes of the reports, the team used a wide array of technological tools to come to this end. 	

The map as a whole is shown at the top front of the web page, while several excerpts from it focusing on local areas are presented within the report to illustrate the written analysis. There is also the possibility for the viewer to choose a location of their own and check what comes up then. There are two distinct view modes of the same data: Diversity and Race. There is also a possibility to travel through years to check the recent evolution of the data thanks to an interactive map.

Like the Reuters report about the Royinga crisis, the Washington Post's feature is centered on the map itself: The produced map substantially **is** the very core element of the report, which further comments on it, adding an analysis, orienting the viewer, and proposing hypotheses as well as providing journalistic and historical context. 

But unlike Reuters, the Washington Post makes it clear from the beginning that the map *is* the info. It doesn't try to add extra elements to sell it, - to make it "look good". On the contrary, the elegance comes from the map itself, which is extraordinarily shiny, making this representation of living together in the US something strong and beautiful although no human figure is shown! The elegance also comes from the color choices that have been made for its elaboration: as explained to the Knight Foundation by the interviewed author, colors have been intensely debated within the team in order to be readable and come as logical while yet not giving in to unconscious stereotypes and biases. And indeed, the final map is easy to understand and it strikes by the very beauty of the set of colors that have been selected. The rest of the article, although consistent, is put in relative shadow, with words in white font on a dark grey background. From the map comes the light. Viewers stop by in awe and get away with a better sense of their lives as citizens inside the nation. 


NYT's flooding of Houston: a 21th-century report
=================================================

This New York Times report is amazing because it mixes aspects of traditional journalism with advanced illustrative tools. Like for the two previous reports presented here, it is meant for digital diffusion, not for print.

It is interesting to note as a preliminary that the story could have been almost the same without any of these high-tech illustrations. The story goes like this: Hurricane Harvey prompted inundations that were not expected by the inhabitants of the residential area of Canyon Gate in the Houston area. On this occasion, most of them discovered that the county should not have allowed the developers to build houses in this area as the zone was created in the 1940s precisely to hold flooded land. Now, a lawsuit is on its way. More details are provided on how the flood concretely occurred. 

Instead of telling this story with pictures from the place or the protagonists by a news photographer, the NYT decided to provide additional illustrative elements that complete the story and give the viewers an incredible sense of empowerment about what is going on here. All of them are great, impressive, and straight-to-the-point. They both tell the same story in a different way and make it more precise. Let's have a look at what they are.

The first illustration is a cartographic animation that zooms in on a map from Houston to the problematic zone of Canyon Gate and its Barton Reservoir. At the same time, it shows the amounts of rain recorded during Hurricane Harvey. Interestingly, the animation doesn't launch by itself: You see it if you try to scroll down for the rest of the article. It provides context: both the map (Canyon Gate in the Houston area) and the level of rain. Short texts appear while scrolling and zooming in, telling the start of the inundation and providing quick orientation in the map.

As next, after the beginning of the written article, comes an almost classical press photography, an aerial view of the zone that had been inundated. Here again, the view is useful. The photography itself carries indications added on the picture itself, showing contextual geographical elements, just a very few of them. 

The third illustration is an auto-launching animated map showing the evolution of construction from 1984 to 2016 around the reservoir. It shows that houses were built where there should have been none, and wasn't any until 1984.

The fourth illustration uses again the zoom-in effect through down-scrolling. We zoom in on a cartographic-like aerial view of the zone around the Reservoir. Some additional drawings on the map and text appearing on the left tell the story on how the flood-preventing mechanisms work in normal days and what happened during Hurricane Harvey.

The fifth illustration is almost provocative in its simplicity but also very relevant: it's a classic, old-fashioned cross-sectional schematic showing the dam, the buildings, and the recent flooding.

As beautifully provocative comes the last image. It's a traditional photography, at man's level, of a flooded street between houses. It shows the damage. It shows the place as people who live there see it. There are no humans on the picture but houses, cars, and other elements of the daily life of several families. Lastly, there is also a double symmetry: the houses are aligned along the street in front of us and on the left and right of the picture, while the same houses, in addition, have their own reflection in the immobile flood water in a top-down dimension. Like a frozen picture. Like a testimony of the journalists' ultimate intent: Stopping at human level; knowing what matters; begging for life to return; meanwhile, having a look that goes deep into things in the void of logic and due protection of local citizens; knowing that the ultimate mystery lies here, in both individual and collective life of ordinary homes. Journalists are gatekeepers, and stand on the edge when a dam is broken! Without being too cocky yet with impressive tech. On the contrary: they come back to the basics they learned from their predecessors, a drawing and a photograph, thus indirectly connecting to stories from other decades: the tools mustn't make stories like new and unrelatable. This would be a mistake.

As a conclusion
===============

We learn both from good and failed examples. What we see here in these three stories clearly invites for more projects and illustrations using GIS and other new cartographic tools. For all, we can see how it is a language to learn in itself, with a grammar, a poetry and potential pitfalls of its own.
