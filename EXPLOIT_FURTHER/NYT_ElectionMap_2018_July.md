=============
This map was published in the New York Times in July 2018. It represents the votes during the 2016 US presidential election in a new way: it counts the number of votes for the two candidates Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump district by district, and it represents the density of votes expressed in percentage for each district in the form of a choropeth map, where each color represents a candidate (blue for the Democrats and Clinton, red for the Republicans and Trump) but with gradation of the two colors: the darker it is, the higher the percentage of voters for the local winner. 

So, not only red is the color chosen in this map for a district whose majority voted for Trump (or blue for Clinton), but, in addition, the final nuance indicates how high this percentage was. Also, you can zoom in on the districts and get a little window popping up with the name of the district and the final local results, this time both in percentage and in absolute values. 

As a result, we see a map of the US which appears massively red, although another map taking the population density into account, else larger areas for the detailed results, would appear more contrasted. 

It shows how people tend to vote in similar ways to their neighbors, - and that less populated districts (with fewer voters) might be often quite homogenous in their expressed political opinions. The accompanying article focuses on different districts across the US to show the underlying sociological reality of this.

I personally like this map a lot. As said in positive tweets, and as explained in the NYT article about the map, the goal of this map is clearly stated: in quite many areas, people might well "live in political bubbles" to some extent (those areas appearing here in darker tones, especially when few people live and vote in them). In other terms: they are maybe not confronted with many different political views in their daily lives.

I like this map because it is an investigation in itself, starting with a goal (or at least ending up with this ambiguous conclusion as appearing in the title of the map in the form of a question). It tried to produce original data despite criticism about the "non-conformity" of this map for not taking the population density into account as a choropeth map "should" do. Truly, even this criticism reinforces my positive opinion about the map in the end: it dared something, sensically enough, and which yielded results. 

Lastly, it is a beautiful journalistic map because it is intended not only to give an original overview as well new nationwide insights: it is also largely meant to give people an opportunity to see how local districts they live in and around them, or districts they care about, expressed their choice during the Election Day. Politics at the grassroots level.
